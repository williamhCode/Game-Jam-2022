# Game-Jam-2022
SIGGD Game Jam created in 48 hrs! [Link](https://purduesiggd.github.io/game-jam-games/Snowball%20Shoveler.html) to executables on Game Jam website.

### Instructions:
In this game, you have to shovel snow to make a big snowball, while avoiding enemies like ice cubes, Jack-o-Lanterns, and holes. Use the arrow keys to move, and use the space bar to punt your snowball with your shovel (hold space to charge your punt). Accumulate as much snow as you can in 3 minutes, and make sure your snowball or your don't fall into the hole, or else you die! Featuring hand drawn animations in a painted and crayon style!
